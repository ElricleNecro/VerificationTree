# VerificationTree

This code has been written to study [Gadget-2](http://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/gadget/) simulation during my PhD.
This code can be run only one file at a time. It will construct an octree to calculate the density center, following
the Casertano and hut, 1985 algorithm, and the gravitational potential.

**Only particles are supported**

## Dependencies

* hdf5
* gcc or clang
* sqlite3 (should disappear soon)
* a specific library, actually non available, to use the FoF (should be replace soon) selection method

This code has been tested under various GNU/Linux distribution, but it should be able to run under Mac OS X et windows as well.

## Compilation options
